# Cratestack
Cratestack is a technically-finished but unpolished game made in TypeScript, featuring a unique physics engine, eleven finished puzzles based on these physics, and an interesting RLE-compressed level data format representable entirely in ASCII. I have no plans to add more levels or level elements to this game, so if anyone feels like appropriating it and making it into something good then I welcome that.
